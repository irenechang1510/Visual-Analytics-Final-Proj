# Visual Analytics Final Proj

Final project for Tufts's Intro to Visual Analytics class of Spring 2021. The class teaches the principles in designing a visual system for data analysis that can be deployed in both exploratory and machine learning projects. The course explored a wide range of data analysis tools such as Tableau, R, Python, d3 (strong emphasis), as well as analytic techniques such as statistical testing, model evaluation, coordinate views.\
For the final project, we get to try out VAST Challenge 2017 and my team chose mini-challenge 1 for our submission. Our final work comprises of 2 components: the report and our visual system developed using Vegalite.
